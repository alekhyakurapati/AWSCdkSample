# Getting Started

In order to publish or subscribe to events, you'll need to

## 1. Onboard your Application

If your application has not been onboarded, this is a once off step required to setup roles and entitlements and add security policies to the Integration Platform to allow publishing and subscribing to events.

See [Onboarding your Application](./application-onboarding) for more information

## 2. Request Access

While everyone with a Woodside login can view the Schemas in the IntegrationHub, you'll need further access to be able to Register Schemas or Subscribe to Events, and maintain them.

Once your application has been onboarded, you can request access to these roles in [Saviynt](https://ssm-saviyntcloud.woodside.com.au/ECM/workflowmanagement/requesthome?menu=1).

See [Requesting Access](./requesting-access) for more information
