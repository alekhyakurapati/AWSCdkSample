# User Journey - Is EDA Right for your Product?

## 1. Business Requirement Identified

During Assess/Select or Co-Create integration needs should be identified to understand what processes, data assets and systems are involved in integration. Technology selection should consider integration capabilities in their evaluation. Event Modelling is a useful practice for elaborating more complex integration requirements.

## 2. Initial Consultation (upon request if required)

For teams with complex integration needs the Integration Platform team offers an initial consultation to discuss the problem space and provide advice on best practice integration (approximately one hour).

## 3. Is EDA the Correct Integration Approach?

Refer to the **Guardrails in Platform of Platforms**: [Enterprise Data Platform](https://woodsideenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/WoodsideArchitecture/SitePages/Enterprise-Data.aspx#platform-guardrails) and [Enterprise Application Integration](https://woodsideenergy.sharepoint.com/sites/WoodsideArchitecture/SitePages/Integration-Pl2.aspx#platform-guardrails) to confirm that you are using the correct pattern. EDA should be used for asynchronous, loosely coupled business process and system integration.
